            <p>Hi, my name is Kota Ueshima, and this is my first attempt at a coding project, I started off coding because I am interested in the analytical and technical side of it and I hope to grow throughout this process.</p>
            <p>I am originally from Dallas, Texas, but have moved around in my life having lived in Japan and England before. Now I attend college at the University of Southern California and am expected to be a senior this upcoming school year.</p>
            <p>Some of my dreams in the future is to travel the world, become an excellent software engineer of web developer, while having the flexbility to do what I want in my free time.</p>
